//! The book claims the following:
//!
//! We could change the definition of Cons to hold references instead,
//! but then we would have to specify lifetime parameters. By specifying
//! lifetime parameters, we would be specifying that every element in the
//! list will live at least as long as the entire list. The borrow
//! checker wouldnâ€™t let us compile let a = Cons(10, &Nil); for example,
//! because the temporary Nil value would be dropped before a could take
//! a reference to it.
//!
//! But the following example demonstrates otherwise.
